# Spark Developer Training 

The repository contains guides, code and data required for the **Spark Developer workshop** conducted by **Manaranjan Pradhan**

Participants can download the repository as zip file and save to their laptop or desktop. The VM image for running the programs will be prodivded separately during the training. The VM image will have hadoop and spark installed on it. The VM will also contain data and code required during the workshop.

Once the zip file is downloaded, unzip the content to your desktop or laptop. 

Then go to *guides* folder and open *Spark Lab Guide Ver 1.0.pdf*. The *Spark Lab Guide Ver 1.0* guide will take you through all the lab exercises during the workshop.

## Overview

Apache Spark is the next-generation successor to MapReduce. Spark is a powerful, open source processing engine for data in the Hadoop cluster, optimized for speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. The Spark framework supports streaming data processing and complex, iterative algorithms, enabling applications to run up to 100x faster than traditional Hadoop MapReduce programs.
This course will provide you an excellent kick start in building your fundamentals in developing big data solutions using Apache Spark platform. The course is well balanced between theory and hands-on lab (more than 10 lab exercises) spread on real world uses cases.

## What participants will learn?

The attendees will learn below topics through lectures and hands-on exercises
* Deep Dive into Apache Spark 1.5 Architecture
* Understand Spark APIs, RDDs, Data frames, Spark SQL 
* How to do parallel programming and develop Spark applications
* How Spark run on standalone and Cluster including Hadoop?
* Understand Advanced Features and spark internals
* Develop Spark Streaming Applications
* Write advanced algorithms using Spark Machine Learning(ML) Library
* Optimizing and tuning spark applications
* End to End Use Case Implementation

## Duration

3 Days

## Intended Audience 

Architects, developers & data scientists who wish to write, build and maintain Apache Spark jobs. 

## Prerequisites

All the programming will be done using Python, hence the participants should have basic programming knowledge of Python. It is advised to refresh these skills to obtain maximum benefit from this workshop.
